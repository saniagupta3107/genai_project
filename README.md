## 🌐 Real-World Use Case: Meesho Seller (🎉 Rakhi Example)

A home-based seller deals with:
- **Rakhis** (August)
- **Diwali Decor** (Oct-Nov)
- **Winterwear** (Dec-Jan)

Using the dashboard:
- ❌ **Deadstock**: Unmoved Diwali stock in January is flagged
- 🔁 **Restock**: Rakhi stock drops in July → seller gets alert
- 📈 **Forecast**: Predicts peak sale window for woollens
- 🧠 **GenAI**: Writes product descriptions, answers “Why are my sales dropping?”

➡️ This enables **zero-wastage inventory** and **maximum sales** 📈

---

## 📊 Charts Example

- **Area Chart** shows product sales trend over time
- Helps in forecasting and understanding seasonality

> _"My kurti sales peak every December — I should stock more by mid-November."_ — a GenAI-suggested insight
