## 🌐 Real-World Use Case: Meesho Seller (Rakhi Example 🎉)

A home-based seller deals with:
- **Rakhis** (August), **Diwali Decor** (Oct-Nov), **Winterwear** (Dec-Jan)

Using the dashboard:
- ❌ **Deadstock**: Unmoved Diwali stock in January is flagged
- 🔁 **Restock**: Rakhi stock drops in July → seller gets alert
- 📈 **Forecast**: Predicts peak sale window for woollens
- 🧠 **GenAI**: Writes product descriptions, answers "Why are my sales dropping?"

This enables **zero-wastage inventory** and **maximum sales** 📈
